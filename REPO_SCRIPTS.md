# Repository Scripts

These are scripts that must be present in the `ci` directory of each repository that uses the common workflows.

## Build Project

**Script: `build-project.ps1`**

Builds the project. This is passed any build configuration parameters required from the `options.json`, and should call language specific build scripts in `common-ci` where possible.

## Build Package

**Script: `build-package.ps1`**

Build a package ready for testing and publishing.

Any requirements from `build-package-requirements` will be downloaded to `package-files` before this script is called.

This should output any package files to the `package` directory.

## Build Package Requirements

**Script: `build-package-requirements.ps1`**

This should build any config specific requirements for the package. For example, native binaries that need to be built on different platforms before being combined in the final package.

This should output any files required for the package to the `package-files` directory.

## Fetch Assets

**Script: `fetch-assets.ps1`**

Fetches any assets needed for building or testing. This should reuse common asset steps. It is passed a `keys` object as a parameter, which is a hashtable of any named keys passed as secrets to the the workflow.

## Get Next Package Version

**Script: `get-next-package-version.ps1`**

Gets the next version for the package. This must take a parameter of `ParameterName`, which it then must set to a string containing the next version for the package.

This should make use of the common version which returns the versions from GitVersion as an object.

## Install Package

**Script: `install-package.ps1`**

Install a prebuilt package locally from the `package` directory.

As an example, if a NuGet package is downloaded to the `package` directory. This script would install it using NuGet.

## Package Dependency Update

**Script: `package-dependency-update.ps1`**

Updated any package dependencies to the latest patch version. This should reuse language specific scripts in `common-ci` where possible.

## Publish Package

**Script: `publish-package.ps1`**

Publish the local package (which was built with `build-package.ps1` and installed locally with `install-package.ps1`) to the appropriate package manager. This should use language specific scripts in `common-ci` where possible.

## Run Integration Tests

**Script: `run-integration-tests.ps1`**

Run any integration tests for the project. For implementation guidelines, see [Integration Tests](/DESIGN.md#integration-tests). This should use language specific scripts in `common-ci` where possible.

Results should be written to the `[repo]/test-results/integration` directory. Supported formats can be found on the [publish-unit-test-result](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action#generating-test-result-files) action readme.

## Run Performance Tests

**Script: `run-performance-tests.ps1`**

Run any performance tests for the project. For implementation guidelines, see [Integration Tests](/DESIGN.md#integration-tests). This should use language specific scripts in `common-ci` where possible.

Results should be written to the `[repo]/test-results/performance` directory. Supported formats can be found on the [publish-unit-test-result](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action#generating-test-result-files) action readme.

Performance figures are different from test results. These should be written to the `[repo]/test-results/performance-summary/` directory in a specific format. See the [Performance Tests](/DESIGN.md#performance-tests) section for details.

## Run Unit Tests

**Script: `run-unit-tests.ps1`**

Run any unit tests for the project. This should use language specific scripts in `common-ci` where possible.

Results should be written to the `[repo]/test-results/unit` directory. Supported formats can be found on the [publish-unit-test-result](https://github.com/EnricoMi/publish-unit-test-result-action#generating-test-result-files) action readme.

## Setup Environment

**Script: `setup-environment.ps1`**

Setup any environment variables, or install any tools required for building and testing. This should use scripts from `common-ci/environments` where possible. See [Environments](/environments/README.md).

## Options

**Script: `options.json`**

This is an array of options which are passed to the scripts as parameters. For a more detailed description, see [Options](/DESIGN.md#build-options).
